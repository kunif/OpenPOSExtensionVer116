## Example of use

- When developing service objects and applications that use them.

  - Add "OpenPOS.Extension.Ver116" to the project reference (found below).
    "C:\\Windows\\Microsoft.NET\\assembly\\GAC_MSIL\\OpenPOS.Extension.Ver116\\v4.0_1.16.0.0__ad2c9a67c3439201\\OpenPOS.Extension.Ver116.dll"
  - Add "using OpenPOS.Extension;" to the source code.

- Class definition in service object implementation

  - When using OPOS, add "using OpenPOS.Devices;" to the source code.
  - When developing a service object, inherit the corresponding device class and add the interface for version 1.16.

Example code:


    [ServiceObject(DeviceType.Lights, "OpenPOS 1.16 Lights", "OPOS Lights CCO Interop", 1, 16)]
    public class OpenPOSLights : Lights, ILights116, ILegacyControlObject, IDisposable
    {
        ...
    }

- Application Examples

  - Check whether the interface of OpenPOS.Extension.Ver116 is included and then call the method of UnifoedPOS 1.16.  

Example code:


    // The object is declared in Lights litsObj1
    
    try
    {
        if (litsObj1 is ILights116)
        {
            if ((((ILights116) litsObj1).CapPattern & LightPatterns.Custom1) == LightPatterns.Custom1)
            {
                try
                {
                    ((ILights116) litsObj1).SwitchOnPattern(LightPatterns.Custom1, LightAlarms.Medium);
                }
                catch(UPOSException ue)
                {
                }
            }
        }
    }
    catch(Exception ae)
    {
    }
